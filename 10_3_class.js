// Programming isn't the solution it is the method we use to find a solution
// Coding is a skill where you learn how to use different tools
// tools are things like condtionals, for loops, whileloops, variables


while(value !== 'C' && next !== null){ // in most of our while loops we may need more than 1 conditional

}


//to remove, set the previous nodes values to whatever the nedxt nodes value is
//method called insert after 'T'.
// WE use a while toop to find the 'T'

// we set our current next which is T
// temp = current.next
// current.next = new_node
// new.next = temp


// an edge case is a way to try and protect your site. When we do an insert there's a bit of an edge case here.
